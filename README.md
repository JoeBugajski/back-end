# Node.js/Express template

Ready to deploy on Heroku.

Featuring ES6 support using Babel.

I spent half a day trying to deploy a simple Node/Express app to Heroku. 
I wanted to use ES6 with Babel, which was trickier than I thought it would be. 

There are other tutorials out there that basically tell you how to do the same thing, 
but this one is updated for September, 2019.
